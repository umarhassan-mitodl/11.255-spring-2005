Some Guidelines for Journal Entries
-----------------------------------

Every student is expected to submit bi-weekly journal entries commenting on the assigned readings and responding to questions presented throughout the semester.

1.  The purpose of the journal is for you to bring the material presented in class and in readings together with your thoughts and your experiences in the games. It should provide a means for you to develop your own opinions on negotiations and dispute resolution. It can also be a valuable record of your personal development as a negotiator or mediator.  
     
2.  As part of this process, you will need to organize materials from many different sources. This will be much easier if you do it on an ongoing basis, which is why we ask you to write regular journal assignments. These entries also build on each other, which is why it is extremely important that you complete each entry when it is due. **No journal will be accepted more than one week after the due date**.  
     
3.  While you may certainly be reflective and adventuresome in your writing, try to be organized. Before you write your entry, sketch or outline your thoughts briefly. Do not let this become a burden, but a small amount of organization will help keep pace with the course and make your entries more valuable. If you do not take the time to organize your thoughts before you write, much of the value of keeping a regular journal will be lost. Some organization on your part will also make it much easier for us to read your journal and provide comments.  
     
4.  Journal entries need not be long, but they should be concise. In general, you should be able to describe your thoughts in several paragraphs per question rather than several pages.  
     
5.  Journal entries should be typed and printed with margins large enough for handwritten comments. Then staple, tape or glue the entry to a composition book.
