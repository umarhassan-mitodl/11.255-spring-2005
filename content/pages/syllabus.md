Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

Conventional legislative, administrative, and judicial means of resolving resource allocation and policy disputes in the public sector often produce less than satisfactory outcomes. This is true in democracies around the world. Planners, policy-makers, developers, and advocates of the poor, concerned about the fairness, efficiency, stability, and wisdom of public sector decision-making, are constantly searching for better ways of resolving conflicts. Recent advances in the theory and practice of consensus building and dispute resolution are, therefore, of great significance.

This seminar is designed for graduate students with no prior background or experience in the fields of negotiation or dispute resolution. Lectures, case studies, and simulations are used to introduce students to the "art" and "science" of negotiation and conflict management. The class also provides an intensive opportunity to build individual negotiating skills. Occasional guest lectures by well-known practitioners provide an opportunity for students to test some of the theoretical ideas presented in class against the issues that arise in practice.

Some of the most important work in the field of dispute resolution is being done at the inter-university Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School (PON). The Department of Urban Studies and Planning is well represented at the Program through the work of students and faculty affiliated with the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program. We try to build on the last two decades of research at PON.
